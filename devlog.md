Devlog Entry 01 — “The First Echo”
Date: March 21, 2025

This week marks the official start of development for Echoes of the Past, a small 2D puzzle platformer about memory, loss, and impermanence.

I finalized the core concept: players control the Veiled Wanderer, a cloaked figure who can briefly restore fragments of a ruined world by activating “echoes” of the past. 
These temporary reconstructions allow access to new paths and secrets, but never last long—forcing players to move forward even as the world slips away behind them.

I’ve sketched out a rough game map, added boss and mini-boss encounters, placed chests in hidden spots, and designed both main and secret routes. The map was cleaned up for in-game use and now includes a proper legend to keep it immersive but understandable. I also finalized the character design, sticking to a minimal pixel art style that aligns with the mood and is realistic for solo development.

The aesthetic is inspired by Stardew Valley’s simplicity, Hyper Light Drifter's mood, and the emotional sparseness of Inside. The scope is intentionally small—something playable and polished within a short timeframe, but expressive and thoughtful in theme.

The cover art is now up, featuring the Veiled Wanderer in a ruined cityscape, and I’ve added the title using the Pixelated Elegance font by GGBotNet, which perfectly captures the indie, retro-futurist tone I’m aiming for. 

This week was about laying the foundation—defining the mood, world, and core mechanic. Next up: blocking out the first level in Godot, prototyping the echo interaction, and maybe animating the Wanderer’s idle pose if time permits.
