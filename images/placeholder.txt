This directory needs the following image files:

1. homepage_bg.jpg - Dark, atmospheric background image for the homepage with ruins or a mysterious landscape
2. menu_bg.jpg - Different background for the menu page, perhaps showing another angle of the ruins or the memory core

Additionally, you'll need to create the following directory structure:
- images/locations/ - For all location images (city_ruins.jpg, whisper_caverns.jpg, etc.)
- images/echoes/ - For all echo fragment images (shrine_shard.jpg, arch_vision.jpg, etc.)

The placeholder images can be replaced with actual artwork once available.
