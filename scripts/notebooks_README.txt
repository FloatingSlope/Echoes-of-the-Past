Echoes of the Past – Notebook
=============================

Inspirations:
-------------
- Hyper Light Drifter – mood, loneliness
- Inside – silence and emotional restraint
- Jagoda's "video game sensorium" – experiential design > mechanical depth

Design Moodboard (Textual):
---------------------------
- Fog-drenched ruins, faint glow, shifting outlines
- The sound of memory: static hums, quiet footsteps, distant echoes
- No HUD. The echo system is the only visible mechanic.
- Veiled Wanderer: silent, female, glowing emblem; never speaks, never seen

Quotes to Revisit:
------------------
> “Echoes don’t preserve. They *echo*.”  
> “A platformer where nothing stays solid.”  
> “We didn’t build it to last. We built it to be remembered.” – Architect’s Note

Mechanics to Explore:
---------------------
- Echo timer mechanic: should it be visible? Should failure loop back?
- Lore discovery = risk vs patience
- Narrative branches: fragment choice > narrative completion
