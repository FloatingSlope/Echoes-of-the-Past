// ======================================================
// ECHOES OF THE PAST - LORE FRAGMENTS
// ======================================================
// This file contains all discoverable echo fragments that
// the player can find throughout the game. These entries
// provide narrative context, worldbuilding, and hints about
// the nature of the echoes and the Veiled Wanderer's purpose.
//
// Each entry is a self-contained knot that can be accessed
// from the main narrative when the player discovers an echo.
// After viewing, control returns to the calling knot.
// ======================================================
// EXPANSION POTENTIAL:
// - Add visual elements to each echo using JavaScript
// - Create interconnected echo storylines that build on each other
// - Implement "hidden meaning" system where certain echoes reveal
//   deeper context when specific combinations are discovered
// - Add ambient sound design unique to each echo category
// - Expand to 20+ total echoes across all categories

*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 03 â€“ Architect's Note**  
"We didn't build it to last forever. We built it to be remembered. But even memory has a decay rate."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Add 2-3 more architectural echoes that reveal
// the original purpose of the city and its design philosophy

// ======================================================
// PERSONAL STORIES & EXPERIENCES
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_09 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 09 â€“ Personal Letter (Unsent)**  
"I walk past our old bench sometimes. It's still there. At least, I think it is. I can't touch it. My hand goes through."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Develop a series of personal letters from the
// same writer that tell a coherent story about life during the city's decline

// ======================================================
// TECHNICAL INFORMATION
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_12 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 12 â€“ Technician's Log**  
"Echoes are local, unstable, and aggressive. If you activate one, be quick. Or you'll fall through yesterday."

-> DONE

=== LORE_ENTRY_16 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 16 â€“ Echo Research Log**  
"Every echo starts with a sound. A breath, a footstep, a closing door. You can't preserve momentsâ€”only their noise."

-> DONE

// ======================================================
// THE WATCHER & WATCHERS
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_24 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 24 â€“ The Watcher's Field Report**  
"The Veiled One passed through at 02:16. No physical trace. Just a sharp drop in temperature and the static whine of recalled time."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Add more Watcher reports that suggest
// multiple Watchers existed and had different roles/perspectives

// ======================================================
// THE VEILED WANDERER
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_41 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 41 â€“ Scavenger's Sketch**  
A torn page with a crude drawing:  
A figure beneath a moon, arms outstretched. Around her, buildings rebuild themselves mid-collapse.  
A single phrase is scratched below:  
"She carries it all."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Create more entries that reveal the
// origin and purpose of the Veiled Wanderer from different perspectives

// ======================================================
// MEMORY TECHNOLOGY & DANGERS
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_07 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 07 â€“ Memory Engineer's Journal**  
"The masks were never meant for human use. They don't just reflect memoryâ€”they *become* it. Three researchers have disappeared this week. Their quarters remain, but no one remembers their faces."

-> DONE

// ======================================================
// GARDEN & ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_18 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 18 â€“ Maintenance Report**  
"Garden subsystem failing. Reality coefficient at 34%. Flowers persist for 3.4 seconds before temporal collapse. Recommend immediate shutdown or the bloom-death cycle will continue indefinitely."

-> DONE

// ======================================================
// PERSPECTIVES OF CHILDREN
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_22 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 22 â€“ Child's Drawing**  
A crayon sketch on yellowed paper:  
A stick figure with no face stands beside a tree. Above them both, a giant eye watches from the sky.  
In childish handwriting: "The tree comes back when she touches it."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Add more child perspective echoes that
// provide innocent but revealing insights about the world's collapse

// ======================================================
// ENVIRONMENTAL ANOMALIES
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_30 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 30 â€“ Water Treatment Log**  
"We've found something in the cisterns. Not water. Not liquid at all. It moves like thought. It remembers the shape of what touches it. Do not drink. Repeat: DO NOT DRINK."

-> DONE

// ======================================================
// SECURITY & SAFETY PROTOCOLS
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_33 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 33 â€“ Security Override Protocol**  
"In case of temporal convergence: 1) Do not attempt to physically move objects. 2) Wear echo-dampening gear at all times. 3) If you see the Veiled One, LOOK AWAY IMMEDIATELY. She is not a malfunction. She is the system."

-> DONE

// ======================================================
// MEMORY CORE REFERENCES
// ======================================================

=== LORE_ENTRY_37 ===
*echo-lore*

ðŸ“œ **Echo Fragment 37 â€“ Torn Journal Page**  
"...dreamt of the Memory Core again. In the dream, I stood at its center while my memories played around me like films. One by one, they detached from me, becoming independent. I woke crying, but couldn't remember why..."

-> DONE

// EXPANSION POTENTIAL: Add new lore categories such as:
// - Final Messages: Last communications before collapse
// - System Failures: Logs of critical breakdowns
// - Visitor Accounts: Outsiders who saw the city
// - Memory Experiments: Scientific research gone wrong
