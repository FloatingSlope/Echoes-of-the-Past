- 6 collectable echo fragments throughout the game
- Visual representation of each fragment with SVG images
- Echo collection panel that displays all found fragments
- Progress tracking showing how many fragments have been found

### 2. Location Tracking
- 6 distinct locations with visual map representation
- SVG images for each location
- Map interface to see discovered locations

### 3. User Interface Improvements
- Quick access buttons for Map and Echo Collection
- Close buttons for panels
- Number key navigation (1-3) for selecting choices
- Improved echo fragment descriptions and styling

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:
- `game.html` - Main game file with UI components
- `scripts/story_content.js` - Story content and echo fragment data
- `scripts/story_content_full.js` - Extended story content and collection functionality
- `scripts/standard_game_processor.js` - Game mechanics and initialization
- `images/fragments/` - SVG images for each echo fragment
- `images/locations/` - SVG images for each location
- `create_placeholder_images.sh` - Script to generate SVG placeholders
- `index.html` - Simple landing page for the game

### Echo Fragment Collection
Each fragment has:
- Unique ID
- Name
- Description (the actual journal entry text)
- Visual representation
- Scene where it can be found

Fragment images are displayed when collected and stored in the echo collection panel for later reference.

### Echo Fragment List
1. **Architect's Note** - "We didn't build it to last forever. We built it to be remembered. But even memory has a decay rate."
2. **Personal Letter (Unsent)** - "I walk past our old bench sometimes. It's still there. At least, I think it is. I can't touch it. My hand goes through."
3. **Technician's Log** - "Echoes are local, unstable, and aggressive. If you activate one, be quick. Or you'll fall through yesterday."
4. **Echo Research Log** - "Every echo starts with a sound. A breath, a footstep, a closing door. You can't preserve momentsâ€”only their noise."
5. **The Watcher's Field Report** - "The Veiled One passed through at 02:16. No physical trace. Just a sharp drop in temperature and the static whine of recalled time."
6. **Scavenger's Sketch** - A torn page with a crude drawing: A figure beneath a moon, arms outstretched. Around her, buildings rebuild themselves mid-collapse. A single phrase is scratched below: "She carries it all."

### Locations
1. **Ruins Entrance** - The entrance to the ancient ruins, marked with strange symbols
2. **Central Chamber** - A large chamber with a high ceiling and strange mechanical apparatus
3. **Laboratory** - An abandoned research laboratory with strange equipment
4. **Observation Deck** - An elevated platform with windows overlooking the ruins
5. **Lower Level** - A dimly lit level with frost-covered walls
6. **Containment Chamber** - A circular room with a cracked glass cylinder

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` to start the game
2. Navigate through the ruins by selecting choices (click or use number keys 1-3)
3. Find and collect echo fragments to piece together the story
4. Use the Map button to view discovered locations
5. Use the Echo Collection button to review found fragments

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed fragment and location images
- Implement a more sophisticated map visualization
- Add audio effects for echo collection
- Expand the game with more fragments and locations
