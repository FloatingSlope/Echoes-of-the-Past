# Echos-of-the-Past
ENGL 3500 - Final Project

Echoes of the Past is a 2D pixel art puzzle platformer set in the ruins of a forgotten city. You play as the Veiled Wanderer, a cloaked figure with glowing eyes and no past—only the power to briefly restore fragments of what once was. By activating fading “echoes,” you reshape the environment to unlock hidden paths, overcome decayed obstacles, and uncover secrets left behind. It's a short, atmospheric game about memory, impermanence, and moving forward when nothing stays solid for long.
