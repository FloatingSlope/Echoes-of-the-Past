# Echos-of-the-Past
ENGL 3500 - Final Project

**CHANGED!**
Echoes of the Past is a 2D pixel art puzzle platformer set in the ruins of a forgotten city. You play as the Veiled Wanderer, a cloaked figure with glowing eyes and no past—only the power to briefly restore fragments of what once was. By activating fading “echoes,” you reshape the environment to unlock hidden paths, overcome decayed obstacles, and uncover secrets left behind. It's a short, atmospheric game about memory, impermanence, and moving forward when nothing stays solid for long.

## 🛠 Update: Narrative Pivot

As development progressed, the project began to shift away from its Godot-based platforming roots and evolve into something more introspective: a **text-driven interactive fiction experience**, built using **Inky**.

This change reflects a 📖 alignment with the game’s core themes—fragmented memory, emotional ambiguity, and slow, haunting discovery. The visuals, UI sketches, and pixel art designs remain central, now serving as **supporting atmosphere** rather than mechanical elements.

## 🎮 Current Format
- Interactive fiction written in **.ink**
- Player choices tied to memory fragments and “echo triggers”
- Optional lore discovery system
- Supporting pixel art assets (maps, character, UI)

## 📁 Structure
- `/assets` — Concept art, cover art, map sketches, UI elements
- `/scripts` — Ink files for story logic and narrative paths
- `README.md` — Game overview and dev updates
- `devlog.md` — Development journal

  ## 📖 Gameplay Loop & Sensorium

Echoes of the Past builds its atmosphere through a focused loop:

1. **Explore** – Wander through a forgotten city, uncovering ruins and fragments.
2. **Sense Echoes** – Notice distortions in time: glimmers, static, familiar sounds.
3. **Choose to Remember** – Activate fading echoes to restore what once was—briefly.
4. **Reflect** – Read fragments, absorb them, or walk away.
5. **Move On** – Echoes fade. You press forward.

This loop is slow, deliberate, and emotionally quiet. Inspired by Jagoda’s idea of the *video game sensorium*, Echoes isn't about mastery—it’s about presence. You don’t dominate the world. You witness it.
